  abstract =     {This paper is concerned with a class of partition
                  functions $a(n)$ introduced by Radu and defined in
                  terms of eta-quotients. By utilizing the
                  transformation laws of Newman, Schoeneberg and
                  Robins, and Radu’s algorithms, we present an
                  algorithm to find Ramanujan-type identities for
                  $a(mn+t)$. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to
                  succeed, it applies to many cases. For example, we
                  deduce a witness identity for $p(11n+6)$ with
                  integer coefficients. Our algorithm also leads to
                  Ramanujan-type identities for the overpartition
                  functions $\overline{p}(5n+2)$ and
                  $\overline{p}(5n+3)$ and Andrews–Paule’s broken
                  2-diamond partition functions $\triangle_2(25n+14)$
                  and $\triangle_2(25n+24)$. It can also be extended
                  to derive Ramanujan-type identities on a more
                  general class of partition functions. For example,
                  it yields the Ramanujan-type identities on Andrews’
                  singular overpartition functions
                  $\overline{Q}_{3,1}(9n+3)$ and
                  $\overline{Q}_{3,1}(9n+6)$ due to Shen, the
                  2-dissection formulas of Ramanujan, and the
                  8-dissection formulas due to Hirschhorn.},

                  $C[t]$-module basis $G$ for a given subalgebra $A$
                  over a polynomial ring $R=C[x]$ with a Euclidean
                  domain $C$ as the domain of coefficients and $t$ a
                  given element of $A$. The reduction modulo $G$
                  allows a subalgebra membership test. The algorithm
                  also works for more general rings $R$, in particular
                  for a ring $R\subset C((q))$ with the property that
                  $f\in R$ is zero if and only if the order of $f$ is
                  positive. As an application, we algorithmically
                  derive an explicit identity (in terms of quotients
                  of Dedekind $\eta$-functions and Klein's
                  $j$-invariant) that shows that $p(11n+6)$ is
                  divisible by 11 for every natural number $n$ where
                  $p(n)$ denotes the number of partitions of $n$.}

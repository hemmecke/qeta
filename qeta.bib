                  functions $a(n)$ introduced by Radu and defined in
                  terms of eta-quotients. By utilizing the
                  transformation laws of Newman, Schoeneberg and
                  Robins, and Radu’s algorithms, we present an
                  algorithm to find Ramanujan-type identities for
                  $a(mn+t)$. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to
                  succeed, it applies to many cases. For example, we
                  deduce a witness identity for $p(11n+6)$ with
                  integer coefficients. Our algorithm also leads to
                  Ramanujan-type identities for the overpartition
                  functions $\overline{p}(5n+2)$ and
                  $\overline{p}(5n+3)$ and Andrews–Paule’s broken
                  2-diamond partition functions $\triangle_2(25n+14)$
                  and $\triangle_2(25n+24)$. It can also be extended
                  to derive Ramanujan-type identities on a more
                  general class of partition functions. For example,
                  it yields the Ramanujan-type identities on Andrews’
                  singular overpartition functions
                  $\overline{Q}_{3,1}(9n+3)$ and

                  family of Ramanujan type congruences for 2-colored
                  Frobenius partitions introduced by George E.
                  Andrews. These congruences arise modulo powers of 5.
                  In 2002 Dennis Eichhorn and Sellers were able to
                  settle the conjecture for powers up to 4. In this
                  article, we prove Sellers’ conjecture for all powers
                  of 5. In addition, we discuss why the
                  Andrews–Sellers family is significantly different
                  from classical congruences modulo powers of primes.}

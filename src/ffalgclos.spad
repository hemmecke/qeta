\section{Overview}

For the implementation of an ACF in the sense of
\cite{Steel:AlgebraicallyClosedFields:2010} we need finite fields and
algebraic extensions of them. Since in FriCAS we the type of the
finite field must be known at compile time, we create a finite field
that behaves like the algebraic closure of $GF(p)$.

Maybe, eventually, we must create a domain that behaves like the union
of such fields for all primes $p$.

The constructor \code{DynamicAlgebraicClosurePrimeField} takes as
input a prime $p$ and returns the algebraic closure of
$GF(p)$ in the sense of \cite{Steel:AlgebraicallyClosedFields:2010}.

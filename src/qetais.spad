\title{Computation of polynomial relations among Dedekind Eta
Functions---Variant Samba}
\author{Ralf Hemmecke}
\date{03-Aug-2017}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

A variant of an implementation of the computation of of polynomial
relations among Dedekind $\eta$-functions that works like the one in
\PathName {qetair.spad}, but uses the algorithm \algoSamba{} instead
of \algo{AB}.

\section{Overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This code is based on \cite{Radu:RamanujanKolberg:2015},
\cite{Hemmecke:DancingSambaRamanujan:2018}, and
\cite{Hemmecke+Radu:EtaRelations:2018}.

This implementation differs from that of \PathName{qetair.spad} only
by the computation of the algebra basis. Where in
\PathName{qetair.spad} the algorithm \algo{AB} from
\cite{Radu:RamanujanKolberg:2015}, we here use \algoSamba{} from
\cite{Hemmecke:DancingSambaRamanujan:2018} in order to compute a
module basis of the subalgebra.

\section{Implementation}

Let us start with a few common macros.

First of all for debugging.

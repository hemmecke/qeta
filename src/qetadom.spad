\title{Computing with Dedekind Eta Functions as $q$-series}
\author{Ralf Hemmecke}
\date{10-Dec-2015}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  We implement functionality to compute with Dedekind
  $\eta$-functions.

  The code below deals with a expansions of $\eta$-quotients at
  infinity in terms of $q$-series. These $\eta$-quotients generate an
  algebra over some ring $C$ (\code{QEtaGradedAlgebra(C)}).

  Modular function that are $\eta$-quotients and have a pole (if any)
  only at infinity, can be represented by univariate Laurent series
  that have the property that they are zero if their order is
  positive. This domain is implemented via \code{Finite0Series}. In
  other words, in contrast to \spadtype{UnivariateLaurentSeries}, it
  can be checked in finite time whether an element of
  \code{Finite0Series} is zero or not. \code{Finite0Series(C, q, 0)}
  form a \code{QEtaGradedAlgebra(C)}.

  An auxiliary domain \code{Monomials} is introduced that adds
  variable names so that an element of a \code{DirectProduct} can be
  shown as a product of variables raised to some power.

\section{Overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This code is based on the article \cite{Radu:RamanujanKolberg:2015} by
Silviu Radu.

It implements prerequisite domains for the computation of relations
among $\eta$-functions.

Let us start with a few common macros.

These two technical macros are necessary to distinguish between Rep

\subsection{Eta quotient expansions at infity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The domain \texttt{EtaQuotient} implements a representation for $\eta$
functions (in terms of $q$) and products and quotients of $\eta$
functions.

\begin{Hemmecke}
Since in general $\eta$ functions can be expressed as Laurent series in
$q^{\frac1{24}}$, they also can be added.
However, for efficiency reasons (and since it is enough for our purpose),
we express an $\eta$-quotient as a Laurent series in $q$ with a prefactor
that is a power of $q^{\frac1{24}}$, we only can add $\eta$-quotient
that have the same prefactor. So, we implement only a partial addition.
This partial addition is completely sufficient in our context, since we
know in advance that summands have the same prefactor.

\section{Overview}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This code is based on the article
\cite{Hemmecke:DancingSambaRamanujan:2018} by Ralf Hemmecke but uses
newer ideas in order to work not only for rings of the form $R=C[x]$,
but also for modules of the form $R=C[x]^r$.
%
In fact, it works for a $C$-module $M$ and a (multi-)degree function:
$\deg: M \to \setZ^r \cup \Set{\infty}$ with the condition that
$\deg(m) < 0$ ($<$ in each component), then $m=0$.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Definitions and Notations}%
\label{sec:Definitions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let $\defineNotation[N]{\setN}$ denote the natural numbers (including
0).
%
Let $\defineNotation{C}$ be a computable Euclidean domain and let
$\defineNotation[phi]{\opeuclideanSize}: C\setminus\Set{0} \to
\setN\setminus\Set{0}$ be a Euclidean size function (also known as
Euclidean degree or simply Euclidean function) on $C$. By
$\defineNotation{C^\times}$ we denote the set of invertible elements
of $C$.
%
At the moment we assume $R=C[x]$ and $M=R^n$. We shall see later, that
everything also works in a more general context.

For $f=\sum_{k=0}^r c_k x^k \in R$, we denote by
$\defineNotation[initial]{\initial{f}}=c_r x^r$,
$\defineNotation[lc]{\lc{f}}=c_r$,
$\defineNotation[deg]{\degree{f}}=r$ the initial, the leading
coefficient and the degree of $f$. In particular, we define
$\initial{0}=0$, $\lc{0}=0$, $\degree{0}=-\infty$.

Let $\defineNotation[Mstar]{M^*}=M\setminus\Set{0}$.
%
For $f=(f_1, \ldots f_n) \in M^*$, we denote by
%
$\defineNotation[idx]{\idx{f}}$ the maximal $j$ such that $f_j \ne 0$.
%
Furthermore, for $i \in \Set{1,\ldots,n}$,
%
$\defineNotation[initiali]{\initial[i]{f}} = \initial{f_i}$,
%
$\defineNotation[lci]{\lc[i]{f}} = \lc{f_i}$,
%
$\defineNotation[degreei]{\degree[i]{f}} = \degree{f_i}$
%
the initial, the leading coefficient and the degree of $f$. In
particular, we define $\initial[i]{0}=0$, $\lc[i]{0}=0$,
$\degree[i]{0}=-\infty$.

To ease notation, we also define $\degree{f}=\degree[\idx{f}]{f}$ and
$\lc{f}=\lc[\idx{f}]{f}$ for $f \in M^*$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{Definition}%
  \label{def:Ordering}%
  \label{def:degreeSize}%
  \label{def:degreeIndexSize}%
  Let $\defineNotation[<lex]{\RelLessThanLex}\subset\setN^3$ and
  $\defineNotation[<divisibility]{\RelDivisibilityN}\subset\setN^2$ be
  two relation defined by
  \begin{align*}
    \ltLex{(n_1,n_2,n_3)}{(n_1',n_2', n_3')}
    &\iff
      n_1 < n_1' \lor (n_1 = n_1' \land n_2< n_2') \lor
      (n_1 = n_1' \land n_2= n_2'  \land n_3< n_3')
    \\
    \dividesN{(n_1,n_2)}{(n_1',n_2')} &\iff n_1\le n_1' \land n_2\le n_2',
  \end{align*}
  for $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_1', n_2', n_3' \in \setN$.
%
  We denote by $\defineNotation[<=lex]{\RelLessEqualLex}$ the
  reflexive closure of $\RelLessThanLex$.

  For $f \in R^*= R\setminus\Set{0}$, let
  %
  $\defineNotation[psi]{\opdegreeSize}: R^* \to \setN^2$
  %
  be defined by
  %
  $\degreeSize{f}=(\degree{f}, \euclideanSize{\lc{f}})$.

  For $f\in M^*$, let
  $\defineNotation[Psi]{\opdegreeIndexSize}: M^* \to \setN^3$ be
  defined by
  $\degreeIndexSize{f} = (\degree{f}, \idx{f},
  \euclideanSize{\lc{f}})$.

  Let $d\in\setN\setminus\Set{0}$, $n, n' \in \setZ$. By
  $n \mathrel{\defineNotation[=d]{\equiv_d}} n'$ we denote that $n$
  and $n'$ are \defineterm{congruent modulo $d$}, \ie, that there
  exists $a\in\setZ$ such that $n=n'+ad$.
\end{Definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{Definition}%
  \label{def:reducibility}%
  Let $u, b \in M^*$. We say that $u$ is
  %
  \defineterm{reducible by $b$ modulo $d$} (denoted by
  $\defineNotation[<divides]{\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}}$) if and only if
  \begin{gather*}
    u_i \ne 0
    \land
    \degreeSize{b_i} \sqsubseteq \degreeSize{u_i}
    \land
    \deg(b_i) \equiv_d \deg(u_i)
  \end{gather*}
  for $i = \idx{b}$.
\end{Definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Note that from $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$ follows
$\degree{b}\le\degree{u}$, but not necessarily $\idx{b}=\idx{u}$.

In general, from $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$ and $\dividesMod[d]{u}{b}$
follows only $i:=\idx{b}=\idx{u}$, and
$\degreeSize{b_i} = \degreeSize{u_i}$, but neither $b=u$ nor
$\initial{b} = \initial{u}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{Definition}\label{def:ReductionRelation}
  For $u, t, b\in M^*$, $u'\in M$, the relation
  $\defineNotation[->tbu]{\canBeReducedTo{t, b}{u}{u'}}$ holds (in
  words: $u$ \defineterm{reduces in one step modulo $t$ and $b$} to
  $u'$) if and only if there exists $i\in\Set{1,\ldots,n}$ such that
  $i=\idx{t}=\idx{b}$,
  %
  $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$ for $d=\deg(t_i)$,
  %
  and there exist $c\in C$ and $a\in\setN$ such that
  $u = c t^a b + u'$ and either $u'=0$ or
  $\ltLex{\degreeIndexSize{u'}}{\degreeIndexSize{u}}$.

  If $B=\Set{b_1, \ldots, b_r}\subset M^*$ and
  $T=\Set{t_1, \ldots, t_s}\subset M^*$, with $\degree{t_i}>0$ for all
  $i=1,\ldots,s$, then $\defineNotation[->TBu]{\canBeReducedTo{T, B}{u}{u'}}$ holds (in words:
  $u$ \defineterm{can be reduced in one step modulo $T$ and $B$} to
  $u'$) if and only if there exists $b \in B$ and $t \in T$ such that
  $\canBeReducedTo{t, b}{u}{u'}$.
\end{Definition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{Remark}\label{remark:oneStepReduce}
  Clearly, if $\canBeReducedTo{t, b}{u}{u'}$, then
  $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$ for $d=\degree{t}$ by definition.

  Conversely, let $u, t, b \in M^*$ with $i:=\idx{b}=\idx{t}$,
  $d=\degree{t_i}>0$, $\lc{t_i}=1$ and assume $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$.
  %
  Then $a=\frac{\degree{u_i} - \degree{b_i}}{d}\in\setN$ and
  $\euclideanSize{\lc{b_i}} \le \euclideanSize{\lc{u_i}}$.
  %
  Furthermore, since $C$ is a Euclidean domain, there exists $c\in C$
  such that $\lc{u_i} = c \lc{b_i} + r$ with either $r=0$ or
  $\euclideanSize{r} < \euclideanSize{\lc{b_i}}$.
  %
  Thus, if the operations in $C$ are computable, we can compute
  $(a,c)\in \setN\times C$ and $u'=u - ct^ab$ such that either $u'=0$
  or $u'_i=0$ (and, thus, $\idx{u'} < \idx{u}$) or
  $\degree{u'_i}<\degree{u_i}$ or
  $\euclideanSize{\lc{u_i'}}<\euclideanSize{u_i}$
  %
  \ie, $\ltLex{\degreeIndexSize{u'}}{\degreeIndexSize{u}}$, in other
  words, we can compute $u'$ with $\canBeReducedTo{t, b}{u}{u'}$.

  In general, Euclidean division does not necessarily yield unique $c$
  and $r$ with the above properties. Consider, for example, the case
  Gaussian integers $C=\setZ[i]$ with $\euclideanSize{a+bi}=a^2+b^2$.
  Then $3 = (1-i)\cdot(1+i) + 1 = (2-i)\cdot(1+i)-i$ are two different
  Euclidean division steps of $3$ by $1+i$.

  In order to make the reduction functional, we assume a computable
  function
  $\defineNotation[red]{\oneStepReduce}: M^3\to \setN \times C$ such
  that if $u, t, b \in M^*$,
  %
  $i=\idx{b}=\idx{t}$,
  %
  $d=\degree{t_i}>0$,
  %
  $\lc{t_i}=1$,
  %
  $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$,
  %
  $(a, c) = \applyOneStepReduce{u}{t}{b}$, and
  %
  $u'=u-ct^ab\ne0$, then
  %
  $\ltLex{\degreeIndexSize{u'}}{\degreeIndexSize{u}}$.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Hemmecke}
\begin{Definition}
  For $d\in \setN\setminus\Set{0}$, a set $B\subseteq R^*$ is called
  \defineterm{interreduced modulo $d$}, if for any $b, b' \in B$,
  $b\ne b'$ neither $\dividesMod[d]{b}{b'}$ nor $\dividesMod[d]{b'}{b}$
  holds.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}\label{remark:abmiguity}
  Suppose that the set $B\subseteq R^*$ is \useterm{interreduced
    modulo $d$}. If $C$ is a field, then $\euclideanSize{c}=1$ for any
  $c\in C\setminus\Set{0}$. It follows that for any $u\in R^*$ there
  is at most one $b\in B$ such that $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$.

  In general, however, for $u\in R^*$ it is still possible that there
  exist $b, b' \in B$, with $b\ne b'$, $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$, and
  $\dividesMod[d]{b'}{u}$. For example, consider $C=\setZ$,
  $\euclideanSize{z}=\abs{z}$. If $b, b' \in B$, $b \ne b'$ with
  $\deg b = d + \deg b'$,
  $\euclideanSize{\lc b} < \euclideanSize{\lc b'}$, and $u\in R^*$ is
  such that $\deg u = \deg b$ and
  $\euclideanSize{\lc{u}} = \euclideanSize{\lc{b'}}$. To be more
  concrete, consider $t=x^2$, \ie, $d=2$ and $u=3x^5$, $b=3x^3$,
  $b'=2x^5$. Then $u=tb+0=b'+x^5$.
\end{Remark}

To remove such ambiguity as described in
Remark~\ref{remark:abmiguity}, we introduce a reduction relation where
among possible multiple choices, the element is preferred that has
maximal degree in $x$.

\begin{Definition}
  Let $t, u \in R^*$, $d=\deg t>0$, $B \subset R^*$ be
  \useterm{interreduced modulo $d$}, and let there exist $b \in B$
  with $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$. We denote by
  \defineNotation[select]{\applySelect{u}{t}{B}} the element $b \in B$
  such that
  $\deg b = \max \SetDef{\deg b'}{b'\in B\land \dividesMod[d]{b'}{u}}$.

  We say that the relation $\reducesTo{t,B}{u}{u'}$ holds if and only
  if $\canBeReducedTo{t,b}{u}{u'}$ and $u'= u-ct^ab$ for
  $b = \applySelect{u}{t}{B}$ and
  $(a, c) = \applyOneStepReduce{u}{t}{b}$.
%
  By $\RelFunReduce[*]{t ,B}$ we denote the reflexive and transitive
  closure of $\RelFunReduce{t,B}$.
  %
  By \defineNotation[reduce]{\applyReduce{u}{t}{B}}, we denote the
  $u'\in R$ such that $\reducesTo[*]{t, B}{u}{u'}$ and there does
  not exist $b\in B$ with $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u'}$.
  %
  If $u' = \applyReduce{u}{t}{B}$, we say $u$ \defineterm{reduces
    modulo $t$ and $B$} to $u'$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Remark}
  Under the assumption that $B$ is finite, $\dividesMod[d]{b}{u}$ is
  decidable algorithmically and the function $\oneStepReduce$ from
  Remark~\ref{remark:oneStepReduce} is computable, also
  $\FunSelect{t}{B}$ and $\FunReduce{t}{B}$ are computable.
\end{Remark}

\begin{Remark}
  By keeping track of the individual reduction steps, it is clear that
  if $u' = \applyReduce{u}{t}{B}$, then for every $b\in B$ there
  exists $p_b\in C[x]$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    u = u' + \sum_{b\in B} p_b(t) b\label{eq:repr-u}
  \end{gather}
  and
  $\degreeSize{u} = \max_{\RelLessThanLex} (\Set{\degreeSize{u'}} \cup
  \SetDef{\degreeSize{p_b(t)b}}{b\in B, p_b\ne0})$.
  In particular, we want to emphasize that there is no summand $s$ on
  the right-hand side of~\eqref{eq:repr-u} with
  $\ltLex{\degreeSize{u}}{\degreeSize{s}}$.
